# Coffee_Machine_OOPs_Project

This project simulates a coffee machine using object-oriented programming principles in Python 3. The project is designed to help the user understand the concepts of OOP and to demonstrate how they can be applied to real-world problems.

## **Features**

- Interactive user interface for coffee machine interaction
- Selection of coffee drinks
- Ability to add ingredients to coffee drinks
- Management system to track ingredients and machine status
- Error handling for low ingredient levels and unexpected inputs

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine to run this project. You can download the latest version of Python from **[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.
